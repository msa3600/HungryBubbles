    Fixed the trapped bubble issues (I was using AppInfo.MAX_RADIUS as the size of the padding around the screen when it should have been 2 * AppInfo.MAX_RADIUS in order to be able to hold a bubble with a radius of MAX_RADIUS units. Also cleaned out all remaining TODO's and added some more comments.
